## Presentation

### Overview
Our chosen project examines house prices in the Greater Toronto Area in the years 2020 and 2021.

### Reason why we selected the project?
We chose this project because it was an intriguing topic to investigate. In recent years, we have seen a lot of volatility in house price inflation over a short period of time. That is why we decided to dig deeper into this topic to learn more about how the housing market works in terms of location, type, style, and house features (number of washrooms, bedrooms, etc.). We aim to build a machine learning model to predict the sold price with respect to its factors.

### Description of the Datasource
Our data source has 26 columns with important information such as the date the house was sold, the location, the house's characteristics (bathrooms, bedrooms, furnaces, and so on), the neighborhood, and the sold price. 

We were able to gather our data from a licesnsed realtor who has access to the most recent listing information. The link below directs you to the profile of the realtor:

### Questions that we hope to answer: 
o	Do unique features of the house (Washroom, bedroom, area, semidetached, attached) play an integral role with determining the sold price?
o	Does the location, type, style, listing date and listing price play a factor of the sold price?
o	When was it listed and how fast was it sold? 
o	Does location dictate how long a house is listed in the market and if there are any patterns?
o	Does the location showcase a pattern in the over asking prices?
